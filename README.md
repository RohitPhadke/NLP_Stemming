# NLP_Stemming
The next step after [Tokenization](https://github.com/RohitPhadke/NLP-Tokenization) in Natural language processing is Stemming. Stemming is the process of producing morphological variants of a root/base word. Stemming programs are commonly referred to as stemming algorithms or stemmers. A stemming algorithm reduces the words “chocolates”, “chocolatey”, “choco” to the root word, “chocolate” and “retrieval”, “retrieved”, “retrieves” reduce to the stem “retrieve”.  

##**Some Stemming algorithms are:**
* Potter’s Stemmer algorithm, 
* Lovins Stemmer, 
* Dawson Stemmer, 
* Krovetz Stemmer, 
* Xerox Stemmer, 
* N-Gram Stemmer.  

##**Applications of stemming are:**
1. Stemming is used in information retrieval systems like search engines.
2. It is used to determine domain vocabularies in domain analysis.
